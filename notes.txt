       Road blocks
            Martin, Roz, Daphne, Niles, Bulldog Gil and Lilith can block his path
                Variable road block time, 30 seconds to start with
               #this is such a delightful idea, might be a random drop instead of linked to destroying eddies

       Weather
            Interferes with Visibility
                Lighting and power blackout
                Soap Bubbles - optical distortion

brick walls
zap eddie when his eyes are glowing BLUE and he will summon Martin or another Frasier character to sit in a random
location in your path and BLOCK you from traveling that way (early levels, can go the long way round, later levels it's
possible to get trapped between two characters
Characters to have: Roz, Niles, Daphne, Martin, Bulldog, Gill and Lilith

Remember, eddie has supernatural powers, if you zap an eddie when his eyes are glowing RED, it will warp reality,
turning the controls backwards or turning reality upside down

If you make eddie mad, he will summon lightning and make it rain (flashing lights to distract you)

Eddie can have WEATHER powers (visibility blocks)
    Lighning causing a temporary power outage (dim lights)
    Fog causes

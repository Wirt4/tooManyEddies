Next steps
need to be able to exit or restart game after game over
	'Greybox' the game. Can focus on gameplay that way
		Features from book
			Increasing speed
			High Score
			multiple lives
			pause button?
		Features I want
			pop-up obstacles 
			drop down powerups and powerdowns
				speed up
				slow down
			when the wrong enemy gets hit ...
				lightning strike and blackout
				ice slick
				fog
				gravity mode slower movement AND slower lasers
				rotated screen

sprite size means eddie can get under fras's eye lasers, may want a powerup that can catch the fall-through, like a
grenade or a defening shout that makes them back up?

also: don't want roadblocks spawning if eddie falls beneath frasier height

Eddie is an angry God
    "DON'T BLAST EDDIE WHEN HE GLOWS"
    Destroying the wrong Eddie
       Road blocks
            Martin, Roz, Daphne, Niles, Bulldog Gil and Lilith can block his path
                Variable road block time, 30 seconds to start with
               #this is such a delightful idea, might be a random drop instead of linked to destroying eddies

       Weather
            Interferes with Visibility
                Lighting and power blackout
                Soap Bubbles - optical distortion
                fog
                Cam Winston's American Flag (total blackout, a short, 2 second deal)

       Reality Screw
            Possible ice mode for reduced friction
            upside down mode
            inverted controls

 Items to affect frasier - drop down from the celing and the player can collect them
    Sherry
        Slows him down temporarily
    Cappicino
        Speeds him up
            possibility, too many multiplies his speeed too fast for the player to control

brick walls
zap eddie when his eyes are glowing BLUE and he will summon Martin or another Frasier character to sit in a random
location in your path and BLOCK you from traveling that way (early levels, can go the long way round, later levels it's
possible to get trapped between two characters
Characters to have: Roz, Niles, Daphne, Martin, Bulldog, Gill and Lilith

Remember, eddie has supernatural powers, if you zap an eddie when his eyes are glowing RED, it will warp reality,
turning the controls backwards or turning reality upside down

If you make eddie mad, he will summon lightning and make it rain (flashing lights to distract you)

Eddie can have WEATHER powers (visibility blocks)
    Lighning causing a temporary power outage (dim lights)
    Fog causes
